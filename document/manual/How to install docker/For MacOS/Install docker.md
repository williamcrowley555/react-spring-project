# Install Docker
## Steps 1: Checking chip and download Docker Desktop
1. Before install docker, you should check for your chip whether it is an `apple chip` or `intel chip`.
> Requirement
>
> For Intel chip:
>
> _ MacOS must be version 10.14 or newer.
>
> _ At least 4 GB of RAM.
>
> _ VirtualBox prior to version 4.3.30 must not be installed as it is not compatible with Docker Desktop.
>
> For Apple chip:
>
> You must install Rosetta 2 as some binaries are still Darwin/AMD64. To install Rosetta 2 manually from the command line, run the following command:
> ```MacOS
> softwareupdate --install-rosetta
> ```
2. Visit <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/"> this link </a> to download the Docker Desktop suitable for your operation.
## Steps 2: Install Docker
1. Double-click `Docker.dmg` to open the installer, then drag the Docker icon to the Applications folder.
2. Double-click `Docker.app` in the Applications folder to start Docker. (In the example below, the Applications folder is in “grid” view mode.)
3. Click the Docker menu (`whale menu`) to see Preferences and other options.
4. Select `About Docker` to verify that you have the latest version.
